# Hi, I'm Michael Gurule 

**Data Scientist | Production ML Engineer**  
8 years of experience at the intersection of Data Science and Business Strategy.

---
## About Me

- Currently building production ML systems and advanced analytics projects
- MS Data Science + AWS Certified Data Engineer + Google Advanced Data Analytics
- Based in Colorado
- Seeking Senior Data Scientist / ML Engineer roles

**What sets me apart:** 

My background isn't just in code; it's in solving mission-critical challenges under tight consulting timelines. Having spent nearly a decade in consulting, I understand that the best algorithm is useless if it doesn't drive value or if stakeholders can't understand it. Expert in building production-grade predictive models and automated data pipelines that bridge the gap between complex business strategy and scalable technical execution.

<br>

HYPERION is a sophisticated machine learning platform designed to simulate and optimize autonomous drone swarms for the detection, tracking, and interception of hypersonic threats in aerospace and defense (A&D) scenarios. The core idea revolves around leveraging Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to enable decentralized coordination among UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) in high-stakes, dynamic environments where traditional rule-based systems fall short due to the speed (Mach 5+) and unpredictability of hypersonic vehicles.

- **Key Features** Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, Advanced Sensor Fusion, Realistic Physics Simulation, End-to-end Data Pipe Line, Interactive Dashboard, Comprehensive Metrics
