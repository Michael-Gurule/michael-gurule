### *Currently under active development*

## [SENTINEL Multi-Intel Platform](https://github.com/michael-gurule/sentinel-multi-intel-platform)

A production-grade machine learning platform demonstrating advanced sensor fusion techniques for Defense applications. Integrates Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) thermal detection with Radio Frequency (RF) geolocation algorithms for real-time threat detection and tracking.

### Deployed Features

### Multi-Sensor Fusion Engine
- Implements Kalman filtering with covariance-weighted measurement fusion
- Mahalanobis distance data association for multi-target tracking
- Real-time track quality assessment and uncertainty quantification

### RF Geolocation Algorithms
- TDOA/FDOA positioning using nonlinear least-squares optimization
- Hybrid time-frequency solver for improved accuracy
- GDOP/PDOP computation for sensor geometry assessment
- Mixed-altitude sensor network design (500m-2000m) for optimal 3D positioning

### Deep Learning Pipeline
- 1D CNN for thermal event classification (5 classes)
- PyTorch training pipeline with early stopping and learning rate scheduling
- 10,000+ physics-based synthetic training samples

### Features Under Development
- Interactive Streamlit dashboard for real-time track visualization
- 3D sensor network and track position plotting
- Multi-Hypothesis Tracking (MHT) for improved ambiguity resolution
- Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for nonlinear motion models
- Additional Sensor Modalities EO/IR (Electro-Optical/Infrared) SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar)
